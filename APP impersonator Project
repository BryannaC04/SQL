--Think about your favorite apps, and pick one that stores your data- like a game that stores scores, an app that lets you post updates, etc. 
Now in this project, you're going to imagine that the app stores your data in a SQL database (which is pretty likely!), and write SQL statements 
that might look like their own SQL.

CREATE a table to store the data.
INSERT a few example rows in the table.
Use an UPDATE to emulate what happens when you edit data in the app.
Use a DELETE to emulate what happens when you delete data in the app.

--Creating the table

CREATE TABLE game (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    character_name TEXT, level INTEGER, score INTEGER);

INSERT INTO game VALUES 
    (1, 'Hawkeye', 2, 3500),
    (2, 'Black Widow', 8, 68000),
    (3, 'Iron Man', 11, 96000),
    (4, 'Thor', 15, 107000),
    (5, 'Captian America', 25, 370000)
    ;
    
SELECT * FROM game;

-- UPDATING the data and confirming the update was successful

UPDATE game SET level = 3, score = 7000
    WHERE id = 1
    ;

SELECT * FROM game;

--DELETING a record from the table and confirming the update was successful. In this case Thanos snapped, so Black Widow is no more.

DELETE FROM game WHERE id = 2;

SELECT * FROM game;
